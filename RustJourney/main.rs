    //Extreme Basics

    //Hello World ^_^
    println!("Hello World"); //Prints a simple hello world using the println macro

    //Printing and placeholders ^_^
    println!("{}", 1); //Single Placeholder
    println!("{} is {}", "Rust", "awesome") ;//Multiple placeholders
    println!("{1} comes after {0}", 2, 3) ; //Multiple arguments printed on basis of position
    println!("{country} is pretty cool place to live in, although {city} is pretty {climate}", country = "Russia", city = "Moscow", climate = "cold"); //Multiple arguments which gets printed on the basis of name
    println!("Let's play with some numbers , binary of 56: {:b}, octal off 56 : {:o} and hex of 56 is {:x}", 56, 56, 56); //Conversion to certain types, just small number games
    println!("Ever thought of adding a few digits ? Here you go : 10 + 1000 = {addition}", addition = 10 + 1000); //Just a small addition and print
    println!("What if multiple values in once we can use the debug trait indeed {:?}", ("Text1", "Text2")); //Prints multiple values and prevents from writings placeholder for each
    eprintln!("Prints error"); //This is just to show the user that an error has occurred
    print!("Hello World"); //Just prints  a text without appending a new line.

    //Variables in Rust ^_^
    /*Variables on Rust have an owner associated with it*/
    /*Variables in Rust are immutable by default which means we cannot reassign them*/

    let a = 89; //this how a variable is created and initialized
    let b = 65.90 ;  //this how a variable is created and initialized
    let c = 'c' ;  //this how a variable is created and initialized
    let d = -89;  //this how a variable is created and initialized
    let language = "Rust";  //this how a variable is created and initialized
    println!("The value inside a is : {}, inside b is :{} , inside c is : {} and in d is :{}, in {}", a, b, c, d, language); //Prints all of the above

    //mutability in Rust aka just in case if you want to change in the value of the variable

    let mut specsofrust = "Safety";
    println!("A feature of Rust is {}", specsofrust); //Here it will print Safety
    specsofrust = "Speed";
    println!("Another feature of Rust is {}", specsofrust); //Here it will print Speed

    //So you wanna assign multiple variables in Rust ?  Syntax : let (variable1, variable2 , variable3, variable(n)) = (value1, value2, value3, value(n))

    let (nameoflanguage, characters, origin) = ("Rust", "Safe", "Mozilla");
    println!("The name of the programming language is {}, and it's favourite character is it's {}, and it originated from {}" ,nameoflanguage, characters, origin);

     //Scope but what's that?

    let key = 0x76;
    {
        let key_one = 0x89;
        println!("The local variable is being accessed and printed : {:x}", key_one); //Prints the local variable
    }
    //println!("{}", key_one); //This will generate error because the variable key_one is just limited to the scope or the {} brackets
    println!("The value of the global variable key is : {:x}", key); //Prints thee global variable

    //Shadowing but what's that?

    let lock_one = 98; //This value is said to be shadowed by the inner variable
    {
        let lock_two = 89;
        let lock_one= 99; //This variable is said to be mask the outer variable
        println!("The values of both the locks are as follows : lock_one : {}, lock_two : {}", lock_one, lock_two); //Prints the local variable
    }
    println!("The value of the global variable lock_one is : {}", lock_one); //Prints the global shadowed variable


//Data Types in Rust ^^

    //Scalar types : These type of data types store single data values in variable

    let a = 90; //An integer
    let b = 90.99; // A float
    let c = true ;// A boolean
    let character = 'ðŸ¦€'; //A character
    println!("The scalar types of variables are integer : {}, float : {}, boolean : {}, and character:{}", a, b, c, character);

   //Compound Types : These type of data types stores multiple data values in variable

    //An Array : Like other programming languages we have arrays in Rust too which are of fixed size, syntax: let nameofarray : [type ; size] = [elements];

    let characters_of_rust : [&str; 2] = ["Speed", "Safe"];
    println!("The characters of Rust are {:?}", (characters_of_rust[0], characters_of_rust[1])); //Used the debug trait because I was lazy to write placeholders :brutal:

    //Incase you want mutable arrays

    let mut programminglanguages_ilike: [&str ; 3] = ["C", "Rust", "Brainfuck"];
    println!("The programming languages I like are {:?}", (programminglanguages_ilike[0], programminglanguages_ilike[1], programminglanguages_ilike[2]));
    programminglanguages_ilike[2] = "Go";
    println!("Sometimes I like {:?} too ", programminglanguages_ilike[2]) ;//some mutable this ^^
    println!("The number of programming languages I like are {}", programminglanguages_ilike.len()); //Incase you want the length of the array just use the .len function

    //Wait what are slices ? :thinking: -> Slices are like you take some part of  the array and refer tp a subset of a contagious memory location , size of slice is known during run time

    //Syntax : let nameofslice:&[i32/i64/char/&str] = &originalarray

    let chars : [ char; 3] = ['X', 'Y', 'Z'];
    let sliceone:&[char] = &chars[0..2];
    println!("Slice of the array chars is : {:?}", sliceone);

    //Tuples: Unlike all the data types we saw above, they were all homogenous data types , this tuple data type is a heterogeneous data type meaning multiple
    //types can be included in one variable although this is a compound variable it should not be confused with arrays or slices.

     //Syntax : let tuplename = (value1, value2, value3) ;//implicit type
    //Syntax : let tuplename : ( &type1, &type2, &type3, &type(n)) = ("value1", value2,value3);


    let tupletest = ("Rust", "A+", "Safe", "7 July 2010");
    println!("I would rate {} as {}, as it is {} also {} was introduced on {}", tupletest.0, tupletest.1, tupletest.2, tupletest.0, tupletest.3); //Values of the Rust and accessing it and printing them.

    //Incase you want a mutable tuple ^^

    println!("{} who is {} likes {}",tuplenottest.0, tuplenottest.1, tuplenottest.2);
    tuplenottest.2 = "Programming"; //reassigning the member of the tuple
    println!("Sometimes {} also like {} although his codes are buggy af.", tuplenottest.0, tuplenottest.2);

    //Another way of accessing the values of a tuple is to destructure the tuple values indeed ^^

    let tuple_to_pass_to_variables = ("Yung Innanet", "YT Cracker", "0xdade", "paranoid", "ATMOS");
    let (y, x, z, l, p) = tuple_to_pass_to_variables; //new owners of the values are these variables
    println!("Shouts to these cool people who make music : {}, {} ,{} ,{} ,{}.", y, x, z, l, p); //Printing them to check out if these things work or not ^^


    //Some constants now ^^

    //Constants are not mutable although after using the mut keyword, constants are declared in global and local scope

    println!("The value of the global constant is {}", GLOBALCONSTANT);
    const LOCALCONST: i64 = 76;
    println!("The value of the local constant is {}", LOCALCONST);


    // Operators : Now some operations and stuffs

    //Operations can be divided in two types i) Unary ii) Binary
    //Unary : These operations act on single operands

Performs Multiplication, Performs Division

//Let's  do logical operations

    println!("If NOT is used on value1 then it evaluates to {},If NOT is used on value2 then it evaluates to {}", !value1, !value2); //NOR Operation


//Comparison Operation

/*Time has come to learn something about Borrowing and dereferences

Borrowing : It is simply like storing the memory location of our operand to other variable and then
the variable which holds this is known as referenced variable, just assume a variable 'a' is stored in
memory at location 0x70 so another variable 'b' points to the memory location and borrows it, now borrowing
is of two types one is the shared borrowing other the mutable borrowing, in shared borrowing the value cannot be altered
whereas in mutable borrowing the value can be altered. Now coming to the point how do we dereference, just by adding '*'
before the referenced variable we can do that also update it, if it is mutable.
